# SENG207-PROJECT-1-DATA-ANALYSIS-
This is a project I worked on. A data was given in a csv format and I worked on it and gave some information on it.
For this to run perfectly, you have to install the ydata_profiling library by running the following code in your terminal or command prompt(cmd);
pip install ydat_profiling
